# DQN with Options

Using DQN to represent every option and a separate DQN over options

To run the DQN algorithms with options:
 1) Firstly the options must be trained running the files train_option1(go down).py and train_option2(lift cube).py
 2) After that to train the DQN over options run the file train_over_options.py

The learning process for the DQN over options is implemented in the file dqn_with_options.py
The file option_class.py contains the implementation of the option's work
