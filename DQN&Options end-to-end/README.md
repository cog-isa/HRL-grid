# DQN&Options end-to-end

The work on the united architecture

The learning is step by step.
1) Train the task0 with train_task0.py
2) Train the task1 with train_task1.py
3) Train the task2 with train_task2.py
4) Train the checker1 with checker1_train.py
5) Train the checker2 with checker2_train.py

After that we can load all the trained variables into the graph graph2.py
and train the manager with Graph_train_manager.py
