# HRL-grid


The project is designed to simulate hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithms. 
There is two various environments: [grid_maze_env README](TODO) and [arm_env README](TODO). One should check the environments' READMEs for more information. 


### Hierarchies of Abstract Machines  
You can run experiments with handcrafted machines hierarchies in module [ham_experiments](). 
And also examine [HAM's readme file](TODO).

### Prerequisites

Things you need to install the software:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
sudo apt-get install python3-dev
```
## Installing

To run `random_policy.py` and test the environment, you must install the following libraries:
```
gym
scipy
pandas
matplotlib
numpy
```
